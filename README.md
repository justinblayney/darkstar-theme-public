## CSS and Layout Updates
- This theme was originally built using **Bootstrap**, but most Bootstrap code has been replaced with **CSS Grid**.
- Over time, all remaining Bootstrap code will be removed.
- A new **custom navigation walker** will be created to fully transition away from Bootstrap.

## wp-config.php
Ensure your `wp-config.php` file is configured correctly for local development. Hereâ€™s an example:

define('WP_DEBUG', true);  
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);  
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);  
@ini_set('display_errors', 1);  

$table_prefix = 'wp_';
